1. 3
2. 150
3. 150 
4. It will return an array of the discounted prices
5. There would be an error, because the let keyword was used so the variable was not available on line 12.
6. There would be an error, because the let keyword was used within the loop so it is out of scope. 
7. It would return 150, because finalPrice was delcared outside of the loop. 
8. It would return the array discounted which has the discounted values calculated inside the for loop. 
9. There would be an error, because i was declared with the let keyword so it is out of scope on line 11. 
10. It will return 3 because length was declared on line 4 with the const keyword to be the length of prices. 
11. It will return the empty array because it is declared const. 

12. a. student.name
    b. student["Grad Year"]
    c. student.greeting() ; 
    d. student["Favorite Teacher"].name 
    e. student.courseLoad[0] ; 

13. a. '32'  because it maps 3 as a string to 2 as a string
    b. 1  convert 3 to an integer and subtracts 2
    c. 3 adds 3 + essentially -
    d. '3null' combines '3' as a string to a string called null
    e. 4  converts true to 1 and adds 3 = 4 
    f. 0  converts 3 to a string '3' and adds undefined
    g. '3undefined' combines two strings, '3' and undefined
    h. NaN converts 3 to an integer and subtracts undefined, which is impossible
    
14. a. true ,converts 2 to an integer and does the comparison
    b. false ,converts 2 and 12 to integers and does the comparison
    c. true  , converts both to an integer and checks if they're the same
    d. false , 
    e. false , converts true to 1 and checks if they are the same
    f. true  , 
    
15. == doesn't require same type to be true, while === does require the same type for it to return true

16. Code is in the folder

17. It would newArr which would be the values are returned multiplied by 2. I think this would be the case because the doSomething function is passing into the modifyArray call which then gets used in the callback function call with each element of the array, which then gets doubled and pushed onto the variable newArr.
